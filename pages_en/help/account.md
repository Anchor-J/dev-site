## Delete account

For whatever reason, you can delete your account, and while we are sad to do so.

It is very simple but serious to delete your account, please make sure to read the following in detail before you delete.

- The operation to delete your account **is not reversible**.
- All information in your account, including but not limited to: API KEY, widget code, registration information, invoice information, contract information, consumption records, orders, tickets, will be **permanently deleted and cannot be recovered**.
- All Applications and Widget Applications in your account will be immediately **unavailable** and **unrecoverable**.
- Any services in your account that are within the expiration date will be immediately **discontinued** and **unrecoverable**.
- Any balance in your account will be immediately **cleared** and **unrecoverable**.
- After the account is deleted, the original cell phone number and email address can still be re-registered, but even after registering with the original registration information, you will not be able to create the exact same KEY as before.
  
Due to some security reasons, we cannot help you to delete your account under the following circumstances:

- The account is in arrears or locked status.
- Enterprise developers need to contact our customer service to handle the account delete process.

When you finally finished deleting your account, hope to come back one day :)
